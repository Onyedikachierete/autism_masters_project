# Abstract
The study seeks to establish the use of an appropriate machine learning model to detect autism among patients. Autism disorder is a condition that limits the cognitive functionalities of an individual. Detection of this disorder is usually not fast and early enough, creating many challenges for sufferers. Developing machine learning models appropriate for the detection of autism is important. The data was extracted from the Kaggle website. Python programming language was used for the analysis, modelling and deployment.   “Logistic Regression”, “Support Vector Machine (SVM)”, “Gaussian Naive Bayes”, Extra Trees Classifier, Random Forest, Decision Tree, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost algorithms” were used for modelling. The AUC score was used to determine the accuracy of probability while the confusion matrix was used to ascertain the classification model for the study. In this case, we go with Random Forest Classifier with a classification accuracy of 90% after optimization and a 0.925731 AUC Score. The Random Forest Classifier can hence be used for autism prediction for patients. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111323269/192731841-78495813-2ada-4124-811b-292877b17e43.png)
